# Google-Glasses-Research-Paper

A shining technology designed for the human face; Google Glass delivers an unbeatable augmented reality experience that will undoubtedly have profound implications on how we interact with the world around us. Glass displays information in a hands-free format that can interact with the Internet through natural language voice commands. Google Glass will have the combined features of virtual reality and augmented reality. It works on Googleâ€™s Android Operating System. It also uses other technologies such as 4G/5G, Eye Tap, Smart Clothing, Smart Grid. Unfortunately, Google became caught up in the storm of its own making when it marketed Glass. The company wanted to capitalize on the hype, hope, and potential of the product instead of selling reality. But Google Glass is a futuristic gadget that we have seen in recent times. It will prove as a useful technology for all kinds of people including handicapped/disabled.
